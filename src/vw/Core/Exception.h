///
/// Exception classes and related functions and macros.
///
/// The Vision Workbench is intended in part to be used in flight
/// systems, experimental multiprocessor systems, or other
/// environments where exceptions may not be fully supported.  As a
/// result, the use of exceptions within the Vision Workbench is
/// tightly controlled.  In particular, the exception usage rules were
/// designed to minimize the impact on platforms that do not support
/// exceptions at all.  There is a standard Vision Workbench
/// "exception" class hierarchy which is used to describe errors and
/// can be used even on platforms that do not support the C++
/// exception system.
///
/// The vw::Exception class serves as a base class for all VWB error
/// types.  It is designed to make it easy to throw exceptions with
/// meaningful error messages.  For example, this invocation:
///
///  <TT>vw_throw( vw::Exception() << "Unable to open file \"" << filename << "\"!" );</TT>
///
/// might generate a message like this:
///
///  <TT>terminate called after throwing an instance of 'vw::Exception'</TT>
///  <TT>     what():  Unable to open file "somefile.foo"! </TT>
///
/// A variety of standard derived exception types are provided; in the
/// above example, the exception should probably have been of type
/// vw::IOErr.  Also, two macros, VW_ASSERT(condition,exception) and
/// VW_DEBUG_ASSERT(condition,exception), are provided, with the usual
/// assertion semantics.  The only difference is that the debug
/// assertions will be disabled for increased performance in release
/// builds when VW_DEBUG_LEVEL is defined to zero (which happens by
/// default when NDEBUG is defined).
///
/// Note that in the example the exception was thrown by calling the
/// vw_throw() function rather than by using the C++ throw statement.
/// On platforms that do support C++ exceptions the default behavior
/// for vw_throw() is to throw the exception in the usual way.
/// However, the user can provide their own error-handling mechanism
/// if they choose.  For example, the default behavior when exceptions
/// are disabled is to print the error text to stderr and call
/// abort().
///
/// In general the only allowed usage of exceptions within the Vision
/// Workbench is throwing them using vw_throw().  In particular, try
/// and catch blocks are generally prohibited, so exceptions can only
/// be used to report fatal errors that the library is unable to
/// recover from by itself.  Other uses of exceptions are allowed only
/// under a few special circumstances.  If a part of the Vision
/// Workbench depends on a third-party library that fundamentally
/// relies on exceptions, then that part of the Vision Workbench may
/// use exceptions as well.  However, in that case that entire portion
/// of the Vision Workbench must be disabled when exceptions are not
/// supported.  Similarly, if a part of the Vision Workbench that
/// provides a high-level service cannot reasonably be written without
/// the full use of exceptions, then this portion may also be disabled
/// on platforms without exceptions.  In both of these cases it must
/// be clearly documented that these features are not available on
/// platforms that do not support exceptions.  Finally, it is legal to
/// catch an exception within the library for the sole purpose of
/// re-throwing an exception with a more informative data type or
/// error message.  This purely cosmetic usage must be conditionally
/// compiled like this:
///  #if defined(VW_ENABLE_EXCEPTIONS) && (VW_ENABLE_EXCEPTIONS==1) )
/// Obviously this functionality will be disabled on platforms
/// that do not support exceptions.
///
/// Exceptions are enabled or disabled based on the value of the
/// VW_ENABLE_EXCEPTIONS macro defined in vw/config.h.  This value can be
/// set by passing the command line options --enable-exeptions (the
/// default) or --disable-exceptions to the configure script prior to
/// buliding the Vision Workbench.  This option also sets an automake
/// variable called ENABLE_EXCEPTIONS which may be used by the build
/// system to conditionally compile entire source files.
///
/// In either case the default behavior of vw_throw() may be
/// overridden by calling set_exception_handler(), passing it a
/// pointer to a user-defined object derived from ExceptionHandler.
/// The user specifies the error-handling behavior by overriding the
/// abstract method handle().  When exceptions have not been disabled,
/// the Exception class and its children define a virtual method
/// default_throw() which the handler may call to have the exception
/// throw itself in a type-aware manner.
