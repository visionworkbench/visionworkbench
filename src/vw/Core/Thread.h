/// A very simple, abstracted threading system.  Currently this is
/// simply built on top of Boost threads, but its abstracted so that
/// it's easy to port the Vision Workbench to environments where Boost
/// threads do not work or otherwise cannot be used, and because the
/// Boost threads design itself is expected to be overhauled at some
/// point.
///
/// To create a thread, pass in any object that has the operator()
/// defined.
///
/// The rest of the interface is straightforward.  These are
/// the things you will need to implement if you want to use a
/// different thread library.  The interface consists of:
///
/// * A Thread class, whose constructor takes a shared pointer to a
///   Task.  The constructor should invoke the Task's operator()
///   function in a new thread, and the destructor should join the
///   child thread.  The static yield() function should yield the
///   active thread, and the static sleep_ms() function should sleep
///   the active thread for the given number of milliseconds.  The
///   Thread class may be non-copyable.
///
/// * A Mutex class, implementing a simple mutual exclusion lock.
///   This should have no methods other than the default constructor
///   and destructor.  All locking and unlocking takes place through
///   a nested Mutex::Lock class, whose constructor takes a Mutex&
///   to lock and whose destructor unlocks it.  Both the Mutex and
///   Lock classes may be non-copyable.
