ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR VISION WORKBENCH PLATE MODULE

So you think yourself a rock star do ya? You want to play with
the Plate filesystem? Well champ, here's some additional notes to
help ease in finding and building it's dependencies.

The Plate Module requires at least two more dependencies:

 * RabbitMQ C
 * Protobuf w/ C++ bindings

*************************************************************************
INSTALLING RABBIT MQ C

Rabbit MQ's C interface is still heavily beta, so we'll need to check
out their current code. You'll need to have Mercurial on your system. For
OSX users who don't have this, they can use:

 sudo port install mercurial

Here's an outline for downloading RabbitMQ C and installing

 cd (YOUR BUILD DIRECTORY HERE)
 hg clone -r default http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-c
 hg clone -r default http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-codegen ...
      rabitmq-c/codegen
 cd rabbitmq-c
 autoreconf -fvi
 ./configure --prefix=(YOUR INSTALL DIRECTORY HERE)
 make PYTHON=python
 make install

*************************************************************************
INSTALLING Protobuf w/ C++ binding

Source code is available at:

 http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/list

Alternatively for Mac users, they can just:

 sudo port install protobuf-cpp
