/// \file PlateFile.h
///
/// Once written, tiles in the plate file are never deleted.  New tiles
/// can supercede old ones, but all of the data remains in the blob files,
/// and the index maintains a sorted list of pointers to previous versions
/// of a tile.  The sorting key for tiles is a field in each index entry
/// called 'transaction_id', which works much like a timestamp to keep
/// track of the order with which tiles were added to the platefile
/// system.
///
/// transaction_id is not simply a timestamp.  Instead, it is a unique
/// integer assigned to each new image that is added to the mosaic.
/// transaction_ids are incremented as each new image is added.
///
/// READING TILES using the transaction_id
/// --------------------------------------
///
/// Read requests can come from the mod_plate apache module (in response
/// to a web request) or from a mosaicking client (in the process of
/// compositing new tiles in the mosaic).  In both cases, it is important
/// for a read request to return tiles from a consistent version of the
/// mosaic.  In other words, we don't want to read tiles from a region
/// where tiles are being actively written -- doing so would result in a
/// patchwork of new and old tiles, and that would look very bad(tm).
///
/// transaction_ids allow you to go back to the latest consistent version
/// (or any previous version) of the mosaic.  Each read request can
/// specify an transaction_id, thereby forcing the server to access the
/// index as it would have appeared ON OR BEFORE the requested
/// transaction_id.  The index server keeps track of the latest "complete"
/// transaction ID (lets call it the transaction_cursor), and will furnish
/// that to clients if they are simply interested in accessing the latest
/// complete version of the mosaic.
///
///
/// WRITING TILES using the transaction_id
/// --------------------------------------
///
/// transaction_id's are assigned on a per-image (i.e. per transaction)
/// basis in the mosaic.  Prior to writing any tiles, the mosaicking
/// client is expected to send a TRANSACTION_REQUEST message to obtain a
/// transaction_id from the index server.  (Note to self: that request
/// should contain some indentifying information that is written to the
/// index log so that we can reconstruct what happened later if the
/// transaction fails.)  The index server doles these out in increasing
/// order so that each client gets a unique transaction id, and that these
/// ids are issued in the order that they were requested.
///
/// Mosaicking clients should also request the transaction_id pointed to
/// by the transaction_cursor (see above) so that it has a consistent
/// version of the mosaic to use for its read requests during compositing.
/// Both the read_transaction_id and write_transaction_id are stored for
/// use in subsequent mosaicking steps.
///
/// When the mosaicking client completes its work for a given transaction,
/// it is expected to send a TRANSACTION_COMPLETE message to inform the
/// index server of its succesful completion.  The index server uses this
/// information to update the transaction_cursor that can be used for read
/// requests.
///
///
/// CAVEATS
/// -------
///
/// - What happens if a mosaicking client fails in mid-mosaic and never
///   issues a TRANSACTION_COMPLETE message?
///
///   This is bad!!  The transaction_cursor will get stuck waiting for the
///   half-finished transaction ID.
///
///   Possbile solutions: keep track of the number of completed
///  transactions, and force the transaction ID to complete if more than
///   a certain number of transaction have elapsed.  (i.e. assume it has
///   failed and note this failure in the index server log.)
///
///   (But then we should make sure that a TRANSACTION_COMPLETE message
///   that comes back from the dead doesn't somehow mess up the
///   transaction_cursor!)
///
/// - What happens to the transaction_cursor if the index server crashes?
///
///   Transactions updates don't happen very often.  We can afford to
///   write the new transaction cursor location to the index file on
///   disk before we actually update it in the live index.
