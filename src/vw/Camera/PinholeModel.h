  /// This is a simple "generic" pinhole camera model.
  ///
  /// To specify the EXTRINSIC paramters of the camera, we specify the
  /// position of the camera center in the world frame (m_camera_center)
  /// and the pose (or orientation) of the camera in world frame (m_rotation)
  /// (which is the transformation from the camera's frame to the world frame).
  /// In the default Vision Workbench camera frame, the camera's pointing vector
  /// is the +z unit vector, and the image plane is aligned such that the
  /// positive x-pixel direction (increasing image columns) is the camera frame's
  /// +x vector, and the positive y-pixel direction (increasing image
  /// rows) is the frame's y vector.
  ///
  /// --->The user can re-define the direction of increasing x-pixel,
  ///     increasing y-pixel, and pointing vector by specifying
  ///     orthonormal vectors u,v,w. These are intended to simplify
  ///     movement between different camera coordinate conventions,
  ///     rather than encoding the complete rotation between world
  ///     and camera coordinate frames.
  ///
  /// The INTRINSIC portion of the camera matrix is nominally stored as
  ///
  ///    [  fx   0    cx  ]
  /// K= [  0    fy   cy  ]
  ///    [  0    0    1   ]
  ///
  /// with fx, fy the focal length of the system (in horizontal and
  /// vertical pixels), and (cx, cy) the pixel offset of the
  /// principal point of the camera on the image plane.
  ///
  /// Combining both the intrinsic camera matrix K with the
  /// extrinsic matrices, (u,v,w rotation, R and C) we see that a real-world point (x,
  /// y, z), to pixel p in an image by:
  ///
  ///     [  row  ]         [ -u- ]               [ x ]
  /// p = [  col  ]  =  K * [ -v- ] * [R | -R C]  [ y ]
  ///     [   w   ]         [ -w- ]               [ z ]
  ///
  /// p is then in homogenous coordinates, so the w has to be divided
  /// out so that w=1. Here R and C are the extrinsic parameters; R and -R*C
  /// rotate and translate a vector in world coordinates into camera coordinates.
  ///
