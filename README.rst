Vision Workbench
================

The NASA Vision Workbench is a general-purpose image processing and computer
vision library written in C++. It provides core image types, pixel operations,
camera models, interest point detection, cartographic projections, and mosaic
compositing.

Vision Workbench is developed as part of the `Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP)
<https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipeline>`_ and is built
together with it. See the `ASP documentation
